<!-- First: Set your default preferences for chunk options: -->

<!-- If you want a chunk's code to be printed, set echo = TRUE. message = FALSE stops R printing ugly package loading details in your final paper too. I also suggest setting warning = FALSE and checking for warnings in R, else you might find ugly warnings in your paper. -->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5, fig.pos="H", fig.pos = 'H')

if(!require("tidyverse")) install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
list.files('code/', full.names = T, recursive = T) %>% as.list() %>% walk(~source(.))

plot largest contributors and show their status as EU member

#  Change of song duration \label{Meth}

In recent years the hypothesis was set up that songs becam shorter over time for two reaosns. The first one to be preferred by different algorithms which are apparently supposed to prefer short songs and the other reason is the rise of social media, where long songs are not important either but only a few good seconds are important to put them under a video. TO test if that is true and also if this applies to Coldplay and Metallica this will be plotted below.

```{r Figure3, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Caption Here \\label{Figure3}", fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, dev = 'png'}
plot_song_durations(charts, spotify_info, coldplay_cleaned, metallica_cleaned)

```

We can see that since the 1990s across all spotify songs there is a clear downwards trend for the average song length, although the sample size is small, metallica seems to have a slightly decreasing trend too. Coldplay on the other hand has a clear upwards trend for the song duration
