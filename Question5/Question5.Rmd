# Introduction \label{Introduction}

In this project, I will analyze the inflationary impact on the quintessential South African braaibroodjie over a three-year period. Utilizing detailed data from Stats SA and daily scraped prices from a major retailer, I will construct a Braaibroodjie index that tracks the price changes of essential ingredients: white bread, cheddar, margarine, tomatoes, onions, salt, and chutney. The goal is to create clear and compelling visualizations that make inflation trends easily understandable for a non-technical audience. Key graphs and tables will illustrate time-series trends, individual ingredient indexes, and rolling correlations.

Additionally, I will provide a comprehensive technical analysis comparing the Braaibroodjie index with the official SA Inflation index. This includes summarizing the data, highlighting discrepancies, and demonstrating the reliability and relevance of the constructed index. The findings will be presented concisely to ensure clarity and impact, with the aim of convincing Stats SA to publish the Braaibroodjie index. The visualizations will be meticulously crafted to be both informative and engaging for the upcoming segment on eNCA, where I will share these insights with viewers.

<!-- The following is a code chunk. It must have its own unique name (after the r), or no name. After the comma follows commands for R which are self-explanatory. By default, the code and messages will not be printed in your pdf, just the output: -->

To begin, I will create a plot to visualize the price changes for each braaibroodjie ingredient over the three-year period. This initial visualization will highlight the individual trends and inflationary impacts on white bread, cheddar, margarine, tomatoes, onions, salt, and chutney, providing a clear overview of how each product's price has evolved.

```{r Figure 1,  warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Price changes of braaibroodje ingredients over time \\label{Figure1}", fig.ext = 'png', fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, dpi=300}

plot_ingredients(statssa)

```

This initial visualization reveals that all these prices have increased over time.

Next, I will analyze how the overall price of a complete braaibroodjie has changed over time. This will involve aggregating the prices of all the ingredients to understand the cumulative inflationary impact, revealing that a braaibroodjie would cost 100 rand more today than it did four years ago.

```{r Figure 2,  warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Cost of producing a Braaibroodje over time \\label{Figure1}", fig.ext = 'png', fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, dpi=300}
index_braai_monthly <- calculate_average_index(ingredients)
long_braai_df <- long_braai(retailer)
plot_braai_price(long_braai_df)


```

The braaibroodje index in the context of general consumer price trends \label{Meth}

I will then compare my Braaibroodjie index to the official CPI index. This comparison will help contextualize the specific inflationary impact on the braaibroodjie within the broader framework of general consumer price trends in South Africa.

```{r Figure 3,  warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Accuracy of the braaibrodje index \\label{Figure1}", fig.ext = 'png', fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, dpi=300}
filtered_cpi <- filter_cpi_data(cpi_sa)
date <- transform_date(filtered_cpi)
filtered_cpi$month <- date
filtered_cpi$V1 <- as.numeric(unlist(filtered_cpi$V1))
cpi_perc <- sa_percentage_change(filtered_cpi, "V1")
plot_braai_index_perc(index_braai_monthly, cpi_perc)
```

The results show that while the changes in the CPI and the Braaibroodjie index are similar, the price fluctuations are more extreme for the Braaibroodjie. This indicates that the specific ingredients of the braaibroodjie have experienced greater volatility compared to the overall basket of goods measured by the CPI.
